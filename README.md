# Shortest-Path-Visualizer
This project enables users to visualize the shortest path between a start and a destination point on a grid while avoiding obstacles. The application supports multiple algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Bidirectional Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Bellman-Ford Algorithm, to find the shortest path.
